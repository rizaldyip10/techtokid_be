# techtok.id backend revamp
techtok.id is a electronic multiwarehouse e-commerce, created to fulfill the requirement for Purwadhika Fullstack Web Development bootcamp final project.

## Stack used
There are slight differences from the stack used for this project. The differences are:
- Using typescript as the programming language, and
- Using prisma.db as the database orm.

Other framework or libraries are still the same, such as express, jwt, handlebars, etc.
